# OLX Average

This is a small api endpoint I wrote in javascript which collects the most recent data in the real estate category on olx.ro and displays an average price.

## Dependencies

This package depends on express, body-parser, cheerio and request

## Installation & Running

Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/andreicon/olx-average/` then run `cd olx-average && npm install` and `node index.js`

## Contributions

I will merge all useful endpoints which use data gathered in the same manner from other websites or on different products.

Won't work for all cities, needs more work
